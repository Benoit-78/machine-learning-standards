Welcome in machine-learning-standards repo.

# What's in there
Machine learning classical tasks already written for you.

## 1) std_eda.py

Contains functions regularly used in data science projects, such as:

  a) EDA 
  
    - plot values repartition on a column
    
    - representing repartition of NaN values
    
    - plot heatmaps

  b) Feature Engineering
  
    - log transform
    
    - scaling
    
    - PCA visualization
    
## 2) std_kmeans.py and std_dbscan.py

Provide with basic ML functionalities of classification & clustering

## 3) std_perf.py

Returns two major indicators : run time & memory taken by the execution of your program.

## 4) q7 folder

Contains std_q7.py script, which provides with standardized graphs in quality management, that aim at decision taking.
  - Histogram
  - Control chart
  - Pareto & pie chart
  - Correlation
